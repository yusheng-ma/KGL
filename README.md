## Encrypting a bench file 
To encrypt a bench file, simply run the main.py file with a file to encrypt, keys, and k (NOTE: python, PyEda need to be installed)
- `python3 main.py "./src/benchmarks/iscas85/c17.bench" --key_values="3 4 5" --k=2`

## Testing algorithm
To test the algorithm in a single file, run the test_bench_file.sh using Linux ( NOTE: NEOS, python, and PyEda need to be installed)
  - `./test_bench_file.sh ./benchmarks/iscas85/c17.bench --keys="3 4 5" --k=2`

  This command will generate the encrypted file (run the python script motioned in 'Encrypting a bench file'), then run NEOS with SAT solver.

### Testing a whole folder
to perform a batch test, run the `./test_folder.sh` file with the following positional 
- Folder path: Where are the files located
- keys: keys to test with example "3 4 5"
  - Key1 = 3  or 011
  - Key2 = 4  or 001
  - Key3 = 5  or 101
- k: number of inputs that the locked gate needs to have 

Example of a command:
- `./test_folder.sh  ./benchmarks/iscas85  "5 5 5" 2`
